# TheJosephusProblemTDD
This was another exercise to practice TDD

## Instructions
At some point there was a war, and during one of its battles defenders were blocked by attackers in the cave. To avoid capture they decided to stand in a circle and kill each third person until only one person remained. That person was supposed to commit suicide. He eventually decided to just surrender. ¯\(ツ)/¯. Apparently this is a real thing that happened and the guy's name was Josephus.
